# Need For Speed: Pro Street Reverse Engineering

This Repo contains info I gathered about the 2007 Game made by Electronic Arts Black Box.
This research is focused on the PC version

## Research Approach
There was no reverse engineering of the executable files
This research was a written attempt of gathering everything already known in the modding scene, by reading the Open Source Projects and trying to reimplement the knowledge
There was some reverse engineering made by myself of some subparts
Sources are in the specific areas
